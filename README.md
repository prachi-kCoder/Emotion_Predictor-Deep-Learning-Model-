# Emotion Predictor Deep Learning Model

## Project Description

This project provides a deep learning model for predicting emotions based on images. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a fundamental technique in computer vision, this model analyzes and predicts emotions from images. It offers a hands-on approach for learners to train their own deep learning models with their datasets, and includes functionality to extract data from web pages using the Developer Tool Extension.

## Features

- **Emotion Prediction:** Predict emotions from images using a trained CNN model.
- **Data Collection:** Extract data from web pages using the Developer Tool Extension and save it in the "data" folder.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Train the model with your own data and evaluate its performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x:** Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Virtual Environment:** Use `venv` to create an isolated Python environment.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prachi-kCoder/Emotion_Predictor-Deep-Learning-Model-.git
   cd Emotion_Predictor-Deep-Learning-Model-
## Set Up Virtual Environment

(bash)
Copy code
python -m venv imageenv
source imageenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `imageenv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies

##Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt:

(bash)
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

##Training the Model
Run the Training Script

Train the model using the provided script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will start the training process with the data from the data folder. The model will be trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze and predict emotions from images.

## Usage
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new images. Follow the instructions in main.py or refer to the comments in the code for usage details.
